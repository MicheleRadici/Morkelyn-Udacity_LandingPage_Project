## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Used external libraries
To develop the navbar and make it responsive, the Bootstrap framework to version v4.4.1 was used.

## Navbar
The Navbar is dynamically generated. The sections present in the index.html and any additional sections are loaded.
From these sections we proceed to fill the unordered list inside the nav and to dynamically insert the styles.

## Responsive
The site is entirely responsive.

## Dynamic loading of new sections
The additional sections are dynamically constructed from those already present in the index.html file. They are then placed in the appropriate section.
